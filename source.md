# Source

A source is external data you can provide to the bot. It can be a web page, a document or a piece of text.

Supported source types:

- url: Any web page, we smartly extract the main content from the page
- text: Any HTML, Markdown or plain text
- document: `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.md`

When you're adding or editing a source, you can select which bots can access it:

Then the bot will use relevant information from selected sources to use to answer your question.
