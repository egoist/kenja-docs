# Bot

You can create different bot for different purposes, for example, you can create a bot to answer questions based on your personal website's data, and another bot for your company website.


## Sources

A bot can access as many [sources](./source.md) you want, it will use relevant information from selected sources to use to answer your question.

## Access to all sources

You can also grant a bot access to all sources, this is useful when you want to create a bot that can answer questions based on any source you have added.

## Limit knowledge to sources

By default your bot will answer questions based on information outside of your sources as well, for example it will answer you who Obama is even if it's not included in your source, because the bot is built on top of ChatGPT which was trained on a large part of the Internet data.

In the bot settings you can limit the knowledge to selected sources only, this is useful when you want to create a bot that can only answer questions ONLY based on your sources.
